## Content
- Three sessions designed to build the foundations of an enjoyable and efficient experience analysing and transforming data in R.
- Initially created to mentor and support my colleagues at City and Guilds Coffee and Code club.
- Uses data and example centred around the theme of the Harry Potter films and books, with data either synthesised or sourced from Kaggle.

## Sections
- Session 1 is called "Sorting" and focuses on justification for coding, coding in R, and getting set up to start working with data.
- Session 2 is called "Spells" and equips the reader with a spellbook full of tidyverse staple functions.
- Session 3 is called "Defence Against the Dark Arts" as it grapples with more advanced concepts for those looking to scale up and automate their coding.
